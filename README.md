Weather Sprint 1
Started on the design and got the api call to work properly/not many huge changes but more will be happening 12/4
//Reviewer: Joseph Poncini:
//Review: Site looks very similar to the prototype, I really could not find descreptancies so good job. The only problem I saw was that the functionality of the favorite location buttons was non-existant so that would be the final step to polishing this project up. Overall, really good job dude
